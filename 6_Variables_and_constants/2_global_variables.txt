Till now, we've declared our variables within the curly braces of the main() function. These variables are called local variables because their scope or visibility is limited to the statements in the main() function that follow the declaration of the variable. This is generally what you want to do. However, sometimes you see variables declared outside of every functions, those variables are called global variables and they can be accessed from any part of your program. Unlike local variables, global variables are automatically initialized to zero.

Global variables have their place, but they also come with some potential problems. Since global variables can be accessed by any part of the program, this means they can potentially be changed from any part of the program. So if you've got a program that's thousands of lines of code, this can make finding errors and debugging more difficult.
