Now, we'll learn about c++ 'sizeof' operator and about the 'climits' and 'cfloat' include files. C++ has an operator called sizeof that returns the number of bytes used to represent any type. sizeof can also be used to determine the size of compound types like arrays, structures and objects. We'll learn about compound types in a future section. In order to determine the size of a specific type, we provide the name of the type inside the parentheses. For example, sizeof(int), sizeof(double). This will tell us the size of that type in bytes on the specific machine and compiler that you're running the program on. You can also determine the size of the variables using their names. In this case, you can use the same syntax or you can omit the parentheses since they're optional for variables. The sizeof operator gets its information from two c++ include/header files, climits and cfloat. climits provides information about integral types(i.e., in programming languages, integral types include signed and unsigned integer types, and character types) and cfloat about floating point types. These include/header files also provide a bunch of handy defined constants that we can use to determine the precision of our primitive types. For example, INT_MAX tells us the maximum value we can store in an int type variable on this specific machine. There are many others, and you can see some in the examples in this slide(open LPA-Beginning-C++-Programming-From-Beginner-to-Beyond-SEP2024.pdf file).
