Creating and Accessing Objects:
------------------------------------
We have already declared a C++ class named Dog  that is located in Dog.h (we'll learn about header files later in this section).

In the test_dog  function create a Dog  object named spot  and, using the . operator, set the name  attribute to the string "Spot"  and the age  attribute to 5 .

You can find my solution by clicking on the solution.txt file on the left pane. But please make sure you give it a go yourself first, and only check the solution if you really get stuck.
