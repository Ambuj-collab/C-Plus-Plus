As you start overloading constructors, you often notice that the code used to initialize objects in these constructors is very similar. Many times only the initialization values of the data members is what changes. One common source of program errors is duplicated code. So we want to minimize the amount of duplicated code in our programs. C++ allows us to use delegating constructors. The idea is that we can now call another constructor of the same class in the initialization list of constructor. The syntax is really simple. After the parameter list, we write a colon and then we follow it with the call to the constructor we wish to call.

It's important to note that this only works in the initialization list. You can't call the other constructors from the body in the delegating constructors.
