Now, we'll use the command line tools to compile and run our C++ programs on the Windows platform. Now obviously we need some sort of editor to type in our code. I'm just going to use Notepad or Notepad++ which is built into Windows and it's really really easy to use.

1) Create main.cpp file.
2) Open main.cpp file and add the following code:
	#include <iostream>
	
	int main() {
		std::cout << "Hello windows command line" << std::endl;
		return 0;
	}
	
3) Now we need to compile and run this. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where main.cpp file is there.
4) Let's compile the code by using the below command:
	g++ -Wall -std=c++14 main.cpp     -->  this will create a.exe file
	
   Note: 
		-Wall  		 -->  this option is for turning all warnings
		-std=c++14   -->  this option is to tell to use C++14 standard
	
5) a.exe is our executable. We can run it by just saying file name
	a   -->  run this in command prompt
	

If you want a different name for the output executable file, we could just put another option on the command line.
	g++ -Wall -std=c++14 main.cpp -o main.exe     -->  this will create main.exe file
	
	main	-->  running executable file in command prompt


Note:
	The -Wall option turns on all warnings

	The -std=c++14 tells the compiler to use the C++14 standard

	Without these options the compiler will use an older standard and not display all warning message.
