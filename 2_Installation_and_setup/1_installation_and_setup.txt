This is a very important section since we described the installation of the tools necessary to create, build and execute C++ programs. So if you're having Microsoft windows, macOS X or ubuntu Linux, we have sections detailing the steps necessary to get up and running on your platform. The following section includes steps for installing the C++ compiler and the CodeLite IDE on specific operating systems. Then we show you how to configure CodeLite so that it's using the C++ compiler we just installed. Then we'll go over how to create a default CodeLite project template that you can use when you need to create new C++ projects. This will make it very easy to start new projects quickly since all the required settings will be ready to go. In all the section, we use a very simple C++ program to test the installations. All the elements of the C++ program will be explained in detail as we progress through the course. In this section, just type in the program and follow along to ensure your installation is complete. In addition to using the CodeLite IDE, we want to be sure that students can learn and build C++ programs even though they may not be able to install an IDE due to hardware limitations. So we created a section that uses just a simple text editor and the command line tools to do just that. If you're unable to use an IDE, then please don't let that stop you from learning C++. You can still use the command line tool. Finally, we'll look at a few websites that have C++ compilers available that you can use to write and execute basic C++ programs. This has some limitations but it's great if you're on the road or away from your PC. All you need is a web browser and you can run much of the code presented in this class.
