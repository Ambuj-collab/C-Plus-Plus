Operator Overloading the Stream Insertion Operator:
======================================================
Given the provided Money class, please add the overloaded stream insertion << operator so that it displays a Money object on a output stream as follows.

If the Money object models 1 dollar and 70 cents, the output should be:
	Money amount {1, 70};
	std::cout << amount;
Output:  dollars: 1 cents: 70 

No '\n' or endl should be added.

You ONLY need to write the overloaded operator function, our automated tester will create the object and test it.

This overloaded operator should return a reference to a std::ostream object and should be implemented as a non-member friend function.

First, add the overloaded operator function declaration to the Money class declaration as a friend in Money.h file

Second, add the overloaded operator function definition in Money.cpp file

This overloaded operator function should not modify the Money object in any way.
